# Skylar's Modpack (Fabric and Sodium)
This is a Fabric modpack created by Skylar (aka me). I spent a few years making this modpack and, I think its pretty good. I started making it in version 1.20.1 (unfortunately, I lost all of my previous versions due to me installing Windows 10 on my old PC (a late-2014 Mac mini btw)), and I've been updating my modlist and getting all of the mods that I like up and running.
